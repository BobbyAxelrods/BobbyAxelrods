I'm a Data engineer and Analystüíª
</h2> 

With more than 4 years of experience as a data engineer, I've developed a deep skill set in designing, constructing, and managing data pipelines and infrastructure. My work supports a variety of analytical and business intelligence needs. I have a solid proficiency in diverse technologies and tools, including but not limited to SQL, Python, ETL frameworks, and big data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark.

My GitHub account hosts an array of projects and code samples that demonstrate my expertise in the field of data engineering. These projects not only exhibit my abilities in extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple sources, but they also reflect my data modeling, visualization, and reporting skills.

I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I am open to collaborating with other professionals in the field. I invite you to connect with me on GitHub to explore my work, exchange ideas, and share knowledge.
